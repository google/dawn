# Custom templates for wrapping Meson based builds, i.e. mesa, in GN
# rules so that they can be used as part of the Dawn and Chromium
# builds. These rules invoke meson for actually running the build
# process, so behave like opaque external scripts.
#
# The external API is 'meson_target' at the bottom of this file
#
# Meson builds are split into two stages from the perspective of
# GN. There is a `meson setup` stage which generates all of the
# dynamic bits for the builds based on flags/vars and ensures that all
# of the dependencies are present. This is equivalent to `gn gen` or
# `cmake ../..`, and thus the `_meson_setup` targets will run during
# `gn gen` to catch missing dependencies and others misconfigurations.
#
# The other stage is `meson install` which builds the targets and
# copies the results into the appropriate output directory. This is
# broadly equivalent of `ninja -C out/` or `ninja -C out/ all`. The
# `_meson_build` target should depend on an appropriate `_meson_setup`
# target to ensure necessary meson commands are run in order.

# (Technically `meson install` can be separated into compile then
# install calls, but since GN's behaviour is to build to the output
# directory, they are being called as one command).
