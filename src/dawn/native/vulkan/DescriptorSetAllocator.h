// Vulkan requires that descriptor sets are sub-allocated from pre-created pools of descriptors.
// Creating one pool per descriptor set is inefficient as each pool might be a different GPU
// allocation (causing syscalls etc). This class handles allocating larger pools and reusing
// sub-allocations when descriptor sets are no longer in use.
//
// Pools are allocated to be a multiple of the size required by a BindGroupLayout (multidimensional,
// one per-type of descriptor) and all the descriptor sets for a layout created immediately. This is
// necessary because the Vulkan spec doesn't require drivers to implement anything for
// VkDescriptorPool but a simple bump allocator (with the ability to roll back one allocation).
// Instead we allocate all the descriptors sets and overwrite over time.
// TODO(https://crbug.com/439522242): We could reuse allocators between BindGroupLayouts with the
// same amount of descriptors if we added logic to be resilient to vkAllocateDescriptorSet failures
// and some form of GCing / repointing of the dawn::native::vulkan::BindGroupLayout.
//
// It is RefCounted because when descriptor set is destroyed, the allocator is added to a
// notification queue on the device to get called back when the queue serial is completed. As such
// it has multiple owners: the BindGroupLayout it corresponds to, and sometimes the device as well.
